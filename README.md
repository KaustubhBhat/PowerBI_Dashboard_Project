IPL ANALYSIS

Overview : The project is a Power BI dashboard analyzing data from the Indian Premier League (IPL), a popular cricket league in India. It covers the seasons from 2008 to 2022 and includes two tables for matches and ball-to-ball data. The dashboard includes key performance indicators (KPIs) such as title winners, leading batsmen (orange cap), leading bowlers (purple cap), and total tournament sixers and fours. It also provides detailed batting and bowling statistics for players, allowing users to select and search for specific players and seasons. Other visualizations include donut charts showing match wins based on toss decision and result type, clustered bar charts for match wins by venue, and a bar chart showing total wins for each team in a season. The dashboard is designed to provide insights into IPL data and showcase advanced capabilities of Power BI.

Description:

- I am currently developing a Power BI dashboard project to analyze data from the Indian Premier League (IPL) from 2008 to 2022.
- I am performing data cleaning, processing, and modeling to prepare the data for analysis.
- I am building a complex dashboard using DAX queries and measures to calculate key performance indicators (KPIs) such as title winners, orange/purple caps, total tournament sixers and fours.
- I have created a date table to enable accurate sorting, filtering, and analysis of data based on dates and time periods.
- I have established relationships between the three tables to pull data together for meaningful visualizations.
- Included in the dashboard is an IPL Batting Stats visual with a dropdown to select/search batsmen and display their total runs, sixes, fours, and strike rate for each season using slicers.
- I have incorporated an IPL Bowling Stats visual with a similar dropdown to select/search bowlers and showcase their total wickets, economy, average, and strike rate for each season.
- I have designed a donut chart to illustrate match wins based on toss decision (field or bat) and another donut chart to depict match wins by result type (runs or wickets).
- I am utilizing clustered bar charts to showcase match wins by venue, with legends for runs and wickets, and data labels to enhance readability.
- I have implemented a bar chart to visualize the total win count for each team in a particular season.
- I have added a slicer allowing users to filter data based on the selected year from 2008 to 2022.
- I am demonstrating proficiency in data analysis, visualization, and advanced features of Power BI in this professional project.
